Summary     : Data Plane Development Kit that consists of libraries to accelerate packet processing workloads.
Description :
DPDK is the Data Plane Development Kit that consists of libraries to
accelerate packet processing workloads running on a wide variety of CPU architectures.

In a world where the network is becoming fundamental to the way
people communicate, performance, throughput, and latency are increasingly
important for applications like wireless core and access,
wireline infrastructure, routers, load balancers, firewalls, video streaming,
VoIP, and more. By enabling very fast packet processing,
DPDK is making it possible for the telecommunications industry
to move performance-sensitive applications like the backbone for
mobile networks and voice to the cloud. It was also identified as
a key enabling technology for Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)
in the original ETSI NFV White Paper.
